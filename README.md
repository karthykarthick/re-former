# Re-former Project
  The aim of this project is practicing what we have learned about creating Forms in Ruby on Rails. We have created the back-end of a blog in which you can:
* Create a username, email and password through a form_for;
* Edit the usernames, emails and passwords created;
* Open an index with all Users created and create new ones;

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails version 6.0
